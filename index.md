> With video games I love to watch and play a lot! I watch a lot of video games on mostly [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/) and I also watch some on gaming and other entertainment on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/). Some of my favorite streamers are [Ludwig Ahgren/Ludwig](https://www.twitch.tv/ludwig), [TimTheTatMan](https://www.twitch.tv/timthetatman), and [Scump/Seth Abner](https://www.twitch.tv/scump).

I have been following this specific esport since 2013 and keep loving it more and more every year.
## 3. Music 
### Favorite Artists:
* Juice WRLD
* The Kid LAROI
* Polo G
* **MANY MORE**
> I really enjoy listening to music because I believe that music is in a way a form of art no matter the genre. I used to not listen to music as much as I do now and I think music is also a way of expressing yourself wither performing or even just listening. With my enjoyment for music I have found other entertainment I enjoy that is apart of the music world, for example I really enjoy this rather new music video creator/producer named [Cole Bennett](https://www.youtube.com/user/GooodLifeFilms), linked is his brand's YouTube channel, Lyrical Lemonade. I would definatly recommend checking out a video or two not even for the music but for the very cool and crazy editing involved.
