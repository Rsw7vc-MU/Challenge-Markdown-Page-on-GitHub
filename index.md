# Interests
## 1. Sports
### Favorite Sports:
* **Baseball (MLB)**
  * Favorite team is the **Saint Louis Cardinals**!
* **Football (NFL)**
  * Favorite teams are the **Kansas City Chiefs**, **Seattle Seahawks**, and the **New Orleans Saints**!
* **Hockey (NHL)**

> I really enjoy watching and playing sports. I would not say I am a big sports fan as much as I was as I was when I was younger but anytime I can I try to watch or play. My favorite sport is Baseball/MLB because I played from age 4 to 18 and just found it the most intricate and educational game I had ever played. I learned so much about myself and about life while playing and will love it till I die. I do like other sports like the ones listed above and do a little gambling on those, but of course I gamble responsibly obviously, and have found a lot of fun and in that and I really love fantasy sports as well.
## 2. Video Games
### Favorite Video Games:
* _Call of Duty_ 
* _Dota 2_ 
* _Valorant_ 
* _Fortnite_ 
> With video games I love to watch and play a lot! I watch a lot of video games on mostly [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/) and I also watch some on gaming and other entertainment on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/). Some of my favorite streamers are [Ludwig Ahgren/Ludwig](https://www.twitch.tv/ludwig), [TimTheTatMan](https://www.twitch.tv/timthetatman), and [Scump/Seth Abner](https://www.twitch.tv/scump). One more thing I love with video games is I love watching professional _Esports_, especially [The Call of Duty League](https://www.callofdutyleague.com/en-us/) and my favorite team is OpTic Gaming - [OpTic Chicago](https://optic.callofdutyleague.com/en-us). I have been following this specific esport since 2013 and keep loving it more and more every year.
## 3. Music 
### Favorite Artists:
* Juice WRLD 
* The Kid LAROI 
* Polo G 
* Lil Peep 
* **MANY MORE** 
> I really enjoy listening to music because I believe that music is in a way a form of art no matter the genre. I used to not listen to music as much as I do now and I think music is also a way of expressing yourself whether performing or even just listening. I know on the surface my music taste looks very "basic", but I do enjoy many different genres/artisits. Also I use [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) as my preferred platforms...Definetly not a Apple Music fan(LOL). With my enjoyment for music I have found other entertainment I enjoy that is apart of the music world, for example I really enjoy this rather new music video creator/producer named [Cole Bennett](https://www.youtube.com/user/GooodLifeFilms), linked is his brand's YouTube channel, Lyrical Lemonade. I would definatly recommend checking out a video or two not even for the music but for the very cool and crazy editing involved.
